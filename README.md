# rmmMonitor_countFiles
Idea: Don't mess up a server with a directory that exceeds the amount of files in that specific directory. So you can prevent some following errors because of that huge amount of not applied files - for example for importing that in a DMS.

## Examples
You can use that datto rmm component:
1. Monitoring Directories that transfers data between GDI Warenwirtschaft and m-files.
2. Monitoring Size of Import Directory of ELO Professional
